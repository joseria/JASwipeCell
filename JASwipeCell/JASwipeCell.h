/**
 This cell class provides a mechanism for rendering JAActionButtons behind a top container
 view. These buttons can be added to the left and/or right side of the cell. This is a similar
 implementation to IOS 8's mail application. As you swipe the cell, the buttons underneath are 
 revealed up to their max width. If the user swipes past a threshold, the left/right most button will
 pin to the container view and that button's action will fire once the swipe completes.
